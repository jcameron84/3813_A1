<h3>Git Organisation</h3>
Since I am the only developer on this project, I will use the main branch as my development branch. I will post a commit either at the end of a coding session or when I complete a significant chunk of work.

<h3>Data Structures</h3>
<h4>Users</h4>
There are three categories of users: normal users (user), group admins (admin), and super users (superUser).
Super users are the only users who can create and remove users.
Admins can create new groups and add exisiting users to those groups. They can also add and remove chanells from a group, remove users from a group, or completely remove a group.
Users have no permissions other than being able to interact within the groups/channels created by the admins.

<h4>Groups</h4>
Groups are created and manged by admins. A group may contain many channels for different topics and each group can contain many users. 

<h4>Channels</h4>
Channels exist within a group. Each channel will have a name set by the admin which will usially reflect the intended use for that channel. For example there may be a music channel for dicussing music or a movie channel for discussing movies.
